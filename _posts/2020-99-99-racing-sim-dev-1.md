This is meant to be the first post of a series on developing my own racing simulation game. It is going to be a daunting task, and likely never going to be completed.

This time we are looking at my first encounter with Unreal Engine 4, trying to understand how everything fits together as a software engineer, not a content developer. Things that I'm going to look for are common development practices like working effectively with Git or dependency management (e.g. [Conan](https://conan.io/) or [Buckaroo](https://buckaroo.pm/)).

### Background

In April 2019 we had a department celebration in the office, and part of the
entertainment was a racing simulation setup for 10 people, with a couple of
Oculus headsets to try it in VR.

I did not drive fast, but I had an amazing time. A few months later I bought a gaming PC, a racing wheel and a few games.

Over the past few months, I really got into it and have started playing online with friends. At the same time, I've been fascinated by the physics behind simulators and have started learning fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics.

The gaming industry is worth over a hundred billion dollars, and there is little space for indy games. My dream is not to create a racing simulation game that whould sell millions of copies, like Kunos did with the excellent Assetto Corsa, but to build an open platform that can be used by many.

### Empty Project

### Car Project

TODO
 - Watch video tutorials
   1. [Overview and car setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ariPx6M33o)
   2. [Top speed and acceleration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NforiLmU24)
   3. [Handling and friction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vFZ9alQKqI)
   4. [Shocks and moment of intertia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dffa5u44nGw)
 - Extending the basic example?
   - What are the main components of the car?

### Dependency Management

TODO
 - [Cross-platform library integration in Unreal Engine 4](https://adamrehn.com/articles/cross-platform-library-integration-in-unreal-engine-4/)
